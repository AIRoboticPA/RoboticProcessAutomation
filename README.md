Introduction

RoboticProcessAutomation Â® is a generic open source automation framework for acceptance testing, acceptance test driven development (ATDD), and robotic process automation (RPA). It has simple plain text syntax and it can be extended easily with generic and custom libraries.

RoboticProcessAutomation is operating system and application independent. It is implemented using Python which is also the primary language to extend it. The framework has a rich ecosystem around it consisting of various generic libraries and tools that are developed as separate projects. For more information about RoboticProcessAutomation and the ecosystem.


RoboticProcessAutomation project is hosted on GitHub where you can find source code, an issue tracker, and some further documentation. Downloads are hosted on PyPI.

RoboticProcessAutomation development is sponsored by non-profit RoboticProcessAutomation Foundation. If you are using the framework and benefiting from it, consider joining the foundation to help maintaining the framework and developing it further.

Latest version License
Installation
If you already have Python with pip installed, you can simply run:

pip install robotframework
For more detailed installation instructions, including installing Python, see INSTALL.rst.

RoboticProcessAutomation requires Python 3.8 or newer and runs also on PyPy. The latest version that supports Python 3.6 and 3.7 is RoboticProcessAutomation 6.1.1. If you need to use Python 2, Jython or IronPython, you can use RoboticProcessAutomation 4.1.3.

Example
Below is a simple example test case for testing login to some system.

*** Settings ***
Documentation     A test suite with a single test for valid login.
...
...               This test has a workflow that is created using keywords in
...               the imported resource file.
Resource          login.resource

*** Test Cases ***
Valid Login
    Open Browser To Login Page
    Input Username    demo
    Input Password    mode
    Submit Credentials
    Welcome Page Should Be Open
    [Teardown]    Close Browser
Usage
Tests (or tasks) are executed from the command line using the robot command or by executing the robot module directly like python -m robot .

The basic usage is giving a path to a test (or task) file or directory as an argument with possible command line options before the path:

robot tests.robot
robot --variable BROWSER:Firefox --outputdir results path/to/tests/
Additionally, there is the rebot tool for combining results and otherwise post-processing outputs:

rebot --name Example output1.xml output2.xml
Run robot --help and rebot --help for more information about the command line usage. For a complete reference manual see RoboticProcessAutomation User Guide.
